###Project C: Geography and Evolutionary Diversification
###Introduction 

###The Danio genus, a group of freshwater fish that originate from South and Southeast Asia, like India has captivated scientists, fish enthusiasts and geneticists alike due, to its diversity and ability to thrive in different aquatic environments(1). These small charming fish, including the known zebrafish (Danio rerio) have not only become popular additions to our aquariums but have also played a significant role in scientific research. One of the tools used to unravel the evolutionary mysteries surrounding Danio species is the Cytochrome c Oxidase subunit I (COI) gene(2). COI, which is found in mitochondria is highly regarded for its function as both a powerhouse and a molecular barcode(3). This makes it an invaluable resource for studying phylogenetics and evolutionary biology(3). With this gene, as our compass we embark on a journey to comprehend the geographical factors that have shaped the evolutionary fate of Danio species. Through this exploration we hope to shed light on their tapestry of life.

###Our main objective, for this project is to investigate how genetic data and geographic factors interact in the diversification of Danio species. Specifically, we plan to use the COI gene as a tool to create trees that reveal the evolutionary relationships among different Danio species. These phylogenetic trees will provide insights into the history of Danio. By combining data with information, we aim to answer important questions about how geography influences diversification and whether closely related species tend to inhabit the same geographic areas or if their evolution has been driven by large scale separation. Through this study we hope to uncover the connections, within the Danio genus and contribute to our understanding of speciation and evolutionary diversification on a scale.

The outcome is stored in the dfCOI.cluster variable, providing insights into the relationships among the DNA sequences.
